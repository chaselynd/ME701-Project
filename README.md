# ME701-Project
This is my end-of-semester project for ME701 at Kansas State University. The goal is to create a GUI that communicates with an STM32 microcontroller to control settings for an A1339 angle sensor IC.

A1339_GUI_demo.py is a demo version of A1339_GUI.py. The demo version is identical to the original, except the serial communication and timing lines are commented out. The demo version runs and allows all features of the GUI to be displayed without requiring an actual serial connection.
